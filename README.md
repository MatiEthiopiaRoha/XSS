# XSS


Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is one of the most popular and vulnerable attacks which is known by every advanced tester. It is considered one of the riskiest attacks for web applications and can bring harmful consequences too.

XSS is often compared with similar client-side attacks, as client-side languages are mostly being used during this attack. However, an XSS attack is considered riskier, because of its ability to damage even less vulnerable technologies.
